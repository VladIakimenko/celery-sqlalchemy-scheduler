# celery-sqlalchemy-scheduler (FORK)

A Scheduler Based Sqlalchemy for Celery.

> NOTE: The project is forked from https://github.com/AngelLiang/celery-sqlalchemy-scheduler.  
> This fork implements some necessary modifications, related to sqlalchemy 2.0 support. As the support of the original library has been seized.

> I never had an intention to ensure full compatibility. Only the functionality that I needed has been updated. Moreover, the original library was stripped of whatever was not required for my needs. This fork is completely unrepresentative of the original project's capabilities. For the full range of features and functionalities, please refer to the original.
