# celery-sqlalchemy-scheduler (FORK)

A Scheduler Based Sqlalchemy for Celery.

> NOTE: The project is forked from https://github.com/AngelLiang/celery-sqlalchemy-scheduler.  
> This fork implements some necessary modifications, related to sqlalchemy 2.0 support.

> I never had an intention to ensure full compatibility and intruduced changes to every single component of the package. Only the functionality required for the major project [https://github.com/VladIakimenko/budgenator] has been updated. Moreover, the original library was stripped of some models and functions that were not required for my needs. This fork is completely unrepresentative of the original project's capabilities. For the full range of features and functionalities, please refer to the original project.
